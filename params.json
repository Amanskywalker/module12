A Few new custom function are made like ` preg_match() ` to implement the same functionality which is there in PHP like languages.\r\nIt also uses the clean coding method to separate the declaration part from the implementation so it easy to further extend. and also make it easy to understand.\r\nIt used a new size less custom data type ` vector `. Trying to implement c++ vector in c. \r\n### Instruction\r\n- download or clone the repo\r\n- navigate to root directory\r\n- use make to build the binary\r\n- $ ./mod12 to run it \r\n",
